structural_phylogenomics:

  Structural phylogenomic analysis of an alkyldihydroxyacetonephosphate synthase protein
  from C. elegans (GI:17556096, UniProt:ADAS_CAEEL). Analysis indicated that PDB structure
  2UUU fit most closely with the query, and was supported by conservation of domains and
  function across orthologous clades denoted in phylogenetic trees.
  - Files:
    - hmmscoreparser.py - file for parsing GI accessions from HMM score files in tabular form
    - Sequence data in FASTA format
    - HMM scoring files
    - MSA files produced using MAFFT and visualized in Belvu
    - Phylogenetic trees constructed using FastTree and visualized with ETE2 in Python

arath_gpcr:
  
  Bioinformatics analyses for a putative GPCR in Arabidopsis thaliana Uniprot:O04714 (GCR1_ARATH).
  Analyses were performed to find evidence for or against the presence of a G protein-coupled
  receptor in Arabidopsis.

functional_site_prediction:

  Analysis of protein functional site prediction methods using a consensus webserver approach.
